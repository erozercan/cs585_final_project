You can see the final detailed report of the project at "CS 585 Can & Jackson Report_new.pdf".

"construct_transition_probability_matrix.py" contains the code for constructing the transition probability matrix. 

"fish_estimate_kalman.py" estimates the next position of the object using kalman filter. This is for creating a benchmark for our model. 

"fish_estimator_only_uniform.py" is the model that estimates the next position of the object using the transition probability matrix which is constructed with uniform distribution.

"fish_estimator_with_alpha.py" is the improved model.
